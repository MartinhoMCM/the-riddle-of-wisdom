Test your vocabulary and deduction skills as you fill in the missing.
This project is a game of words with Angular and Gemini API

## App Description

The Riddke Of Wisdom is an engaging word game designed to challenge and entertain players by having them complete partially masked words. The game display a word with only the first and last letters visible, and players must fill in the missing letters to solve the riddle. 
To enhance the game's vocaublary and ensure a rich, diverse experience, the app leveraged the power of  Gemini API. By using Gemini API, the app generated a curated array of words across various categories, enriching our game with a vast and creative selection of terms. The API's ability to produce relevant and high-vocabulary allowed me to create a dynamic and engagin game environment.
This is integration not only saved time but also ensured that the word list is continually updated an varied, providing players with an enjoyable and challenging experience every time they play.
